 * 
 * This file is similar to a Java class that contains the main method. 
 * The Processing game engine ("the main method") starts executing the game by 
 * invoking the method setup() and then will invoke draw() 60 times/sec (the default frame rate).
 * The frame rate can be changed.
 *          
 * The two most important methods in this file:
 *  setup():  Initilize variables when app is started, only one time.
 *  draw():   Update variables. Executed over and over again.

 * - First shape/img will be at the bottom.

 *
 * When the game hasn't started yet, display instruction.
 * When the game has started, display score and draw player.
 * Increase the score by 1.
